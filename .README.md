## Deployment

- **Frontend Deployment**: The frontend has been deployed using **Netlify**.
- **Backend Deployment**: The backend is deployed using **Render**.

## Project Overview

This application allows users to manage scheduling information for operators, assets, clients, and allocations through a user-friendly interface. The frontend communicates with the backend via RESTful APIs to perform CRUD operations. The backend handles data storage and processing, while the frontend provides a responsive interface for user interaction.

## Planning

Extensive planning was completed for this project. The planning files can be found here:
[Part A assignment](resources/PartA)

### Changes from the Original Plan

- **Admin Function**: This feature was abandoned due to time constraints and difficulties in implementation. As a result, the user function on the frontend differs slightly from the backend.
- **Color Scheme**: The same color scheme outlined in the plan was used, but in different proportions after realizing the original distribution did not meet design expectations.
- **User Route on Frontend**: The original plan was to have the user route on the top right-hand corner of the page, but due to time constraints, this feature was not implemented. The user route is now included in the navbar and functions correctly.
- **Layout for Create and Edit**: The original plan was to navigate to a new page when creating or editing in Asset, Client, Operator, and Allocation. However, it was found that these actions could be done more efficiently on a single page, so the layout was adjusted accordingly.
- **Login and Signup Layout**: Instead of redirecting to a new page, a modal package was used for a more elegant solution.

## Packages/Libraries

### Frontend

- **React**: Core framework for building the user interface.
- **React Router DOM**: For handling routing and navigation between pages.
- **React Modal**: For implementing modals on the login and signup pages.
- **Axios**: For making HTTP requests to the backend API.
- **CORS**: To enable cross-origin resource sharing between the frontend and backend.
- **React Icons**: For adding icons (GitHub, LinkedIn) to the contact page.

### Backend

- **Express**: Web framework for building the backend API.
- **Mongoose**: For MongoDB data modeling.
- **bcryptjs**: For password hashing.
- **jsonwebtoken**: For handling JWT authentication.
- **dotenv**: For managing environment variables.
- **cors**: For enabling cross-origin resource sharing.
- **nodemon** (Dev Dependency): For automatically restarting the server during development.

## Routes/Pages

### Frontend

The application is divided into several pages, each accessible through specific routes:

- **Dashboard Page** (`/`): Home page displaying a summary of allocations, assets, clients, and operators.
- **Login Page** (`/login`): Allows users to log in; redirects to the dashboard upon successful login.
- **Operator Page** (`/operator`): Manage operators, including creating, updating, and deleting operator records.
- **Asset Page** (`/asset`): Manage assets with options to create, update, and delete asset records.
- **Client Page** (`/client`): Manage client information with full CRUD functionality.
- **Allocation Page** (`/allocation`): Manage allocations, including assigning assets and operators to clients.
- **User Page** (`/user`): Manage user details; currently allows editing and deleting user profiles.
- **Contact Page** (`/contact`): Displays contact information with links to GitHub and LinkedIn profiles.

### Backend

Each data model in the backend has its own route:

- **User**: `/users`
- **Asset**: `/assets`
- **Operator**: `/operators`
- **Client**: `/clients`
- **Allocation**: `/allocations`

These routes handle all CRUD operations and include authentication checks using JWT tokens.

## Contexts

### Frontend

- **Authentication Context**: Used to manage user authentication state across the application, ensuring only authenticated users can access certain pages.

## Data Management

### Frontend

The application handles the following data entities, each corresponding to specific pages:

- **Login**: Authenticates users and manages session tokens.
- **Operator**: Handles data related to operators, including license classes and available days.
- **Asset**: Manages assets, including asset types and registration information.
- **Client**: Manages client information and associated projects.
- **Allocation**: Manages the allocation of assets and operators to clients.
- **User**: Handles user profiles, allowing updates to user details.

### Backend

The backend manages the following models:

- **User**: Handles user authentication and authorization.
- **Asset**: Manages details about assets, such as asset number, type, and registration information.
- **Operator**: Manages operators, including their license classes and availability.
- **Client**: Manages client information, including associated projects.
- **Allocation**: Manages the assignment of assets and operators to clients.

## Components

### Frontend

The application is built with reusable components to enhance maintainability and scalability:

- **NavBar**: A responsive navigation bar that includes links to different pages and a logout button. It dynamically changes color based on the current active page.
- **Header**: Contains the application’s logo and a link back to the dashboard.
- **Button**: Customizable buttons used throughout the application, with styles that change on hover and active states.

## Styling (CSS)

### Frontend

The application uses a modular CSS approach, with separate files for each component and page:

- **Global Styles** (`global.css`): Contains the base styles for the entire application, including typography and colors.
- **Button Styles** (`buttons.css`): Defines the styles for primary, secondary, and disabled buttons.
- **Page-Specific Styles**: Each page has its own CSS file to handle unique styling needs:
  - `dashboardPage.css`
  - `operatorPage.css`
  - `assetPage.css`
  - `clientPage.css`
  - `allocationPage.css`
  - `userPage.css`
  - `contactPage.css`
- **Responsive Design**: CSS media queries are used to ensure the application is fully responsive and usable on different screen sizes.

## Functional Overview

### Frontend

The application is designed with the following functionalities:

- **Authentication**: Users must log in to access most of the pages. JWT tokens are stored in local storage to maintain sessions.
- **CRUD Operations**: Each data entity (operator, asset, client, allocation, user) can be created, read, updated, and deleted through the respective pages.
- **Responsive Design**: The application is fully responsive, with layouts adjusting for mobile, tablet, and desktop screens.
- **Modals**: The login and signup forms are displayed in modals, providing a smooth user experience without navigating away from the current page.

## Future Enhancements

### Frontend

- **Dark/Light Mode**: Implement a theme toggle that allows users to switch between dark and light modes.
- **User Profile Page**: Add a dedicated page for users to view and edit their profiles.
- **Enhanced Error Handling**: Improve error messages and feedback to users during operations like login and data submission.
- **Improved Accessibility**: Ensure all components and pages are fully accessible to users with disabilities, following WCAG guidelines.

### Backend

- **Admin Function**: Potentially adding an admin feature to manage users and data.
- **Data Access Control**: Implementing middleware for data authorization based on user roles and the company they belong to.

## Project Management

To ensure the development process was organized and efficient, I used **Trello** for task management and assigned **story points** to estimate the effort required for each task. I also followed the **Conventional Commits** standard for commit messages.

### Trello Kanban Board

- **Trello**: resources/trello baord

### Story Points

- **Story Points**: Each task on the Trello board was assigned story points, which represented the estimated difficulty and time required to complete the task. This helped prioritize tasks and allocate time more effectively throughout the project.

### Conventional Commits

- **Conventional Commits 1.0.0**: I adhered to the Conventional Commits standard for my Git commit messages, making it easier to understand the changes made in each commit. This practice improved the clarity and organization of the commit history.
